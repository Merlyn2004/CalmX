### Project Description
calmX is a productivity and mental wellness app designed to help students efficiently manage their study time. Featuring a Pomodoro timer, study planner, reminders, quizzes, flashcards, and motivational content, it supports students in staying focused, organized, and motivated during their exam preparation.
### The Problem statement
Students often struggle with time management and staying motivated during study sessions. The lack of structured planning and distraction-free environments can lead to burnout and lower productivity. There is a need for a tool that helps students stay on track while also boosting their mental well-being.
### The Solution
calmX provides a holistic approach to exam preparation by offering productivity tools (Pomodoro timer, study planner, and reminders) alongside motivational features (quizzes, flashcards, and daily inspiration). It helps students plan their study time effectively, stay motivated, and manage their stress, all in one place.
